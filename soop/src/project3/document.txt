Based on the examples discussed in the lecture,
try to develop a game in which clicking on a target made up of 10 multicolored circles will count points.
The equation of a circle might be useful to determine which part of the circular target was hit.
Later, you can modify the game by changing the position of the target
(either with continuous movement or by jumping to a new position at regular intervals).
